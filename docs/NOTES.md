# Notes

ReasoningText - unclear documentation. I found some references to it but it wasn't clear what to expect here.

Some things didn't work:

- links in documentation pointed to the wrong spot
- how do you handle provideroptions for all providers?
- fallback providers with all providers?
- documentation for deltas say data.delta but i'm seeing data.text
- i dont see instructions on reasoning streaming
- why can't you do model-level provideroptions? it's per-call?
